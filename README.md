## 📋 Project Overview

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.

This portfolio project analyzes data from **OKCupid**, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users. The project involves formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions about dating patterns and user behavior.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- ✅ Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
- ✅ Build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model
- ✅ Practice formulating questions and implementing ML techniques

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Natural Language Processing
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download Materials**
   - Download the Date-A-Scientist project zip folder
   - Double-click to "unzip" the folder
   - You should see:
     - `date-a-scientist.ipynb`
     - `profiles.csv`

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open a browser tab with Jupyter interface.

3. **Open Project File**
   - Click on `date-a-scientist.ipynb` in the browser tab
   - Start building your project in this file

4. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Create a new Git repository for this project
   - Initialize with proper `.gitignore` for Python/Jupyter projects
